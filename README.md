# 🧲 Coilonel Faraday’s Army

_A regiment of refined mechanisms for those of taste and temperament._

Welcome, traveler. Within this repository lies the documentation, blueprints, and technical considerations for assembling your very own member of Coilonel Faraday’s Army — a curious device of toroidal persuasion, with inner workings powered by flow, flux, and no small measure of finesse.

These machines — modest in appearance yet grand in potential — are intended for deployment in remote locales, field laboratories, or beneath the sands of sun-washed outposts.

Though their purpose may not be immediately apparent to the casual observer, the astute constructor will find in them a marvel of motion, magnetism, and most curiously... self-possession.
