├── mechanical-overview_prompt.txt
"Generate a top-down and side-profile blueprint of a toroidal energy harvester. The torus should be labeled with major radius (R = 0.5m), minor radius (r = 0.05m), and include components such as copper windings, magnetic segments, and flow channels. Use legible reference numbers only."

├── fluidic-loop_prompt.txt
"Illustrate the closed-loop mercury flow path inside a toroidal pipe, intersected by multiple magnetic zones. Add directional arrows showing convection/rotation-based motion. Include internal temperature buffering material zones."

├── em-induction-schematic_prompt.txt
"Render an electromagnetic schematic showing copper coil windings wrapped around a toroid, magnetic flux regions, and current flow. Label wire gauge (AWG 18), number of turns (N = 500), and approximate induced voltage per segment (0.25 V)."

├── enclosure-cutaway_prompt.txt
"Draw a sectional side-view of the entire underground installation. Include: layered containment structure (316L shell, vacuum cavity, steel armor), AI sensor suite (Jetson/Nvidia), cooling fins, antenna port, access hatch, and buried shielding dome."
